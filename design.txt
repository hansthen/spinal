test-run -> embeds *test-results
test-result has an object reference to 1 test-case
    we can also use a string reference as key to test case

test-run has an object reference to 1 project

workflow:
1. we do not want users to send test reports for just any project
2. so after creating a project, users get an api-key (how?)
3. the api-key is used for authentication of (at least) the updates
4. if the project is marked as private, api-key is also used for reports

Use case 1: user registers a project
1. user logs into system :-> spinal.chargebeeportal.com
2. user creates a project :-> also via chargebee = activate a subscription
2a) this is a web hook???
3. user is redirected to a page where they can create an api key (and expire existing ones)

Use case 2: user registers a test run
1. user runs a CI run that outputs TAP protocol
2. user calls the spinal app which is configured with an API key and a project name (in environment variables)
3. spinal uploads the test results for the project

Use case 3: user shows last N test results on an overview page
1. user visits a link with a project page
2. query parameters determine which test results are shown

Use case 4: user gets charged for amount used
1. billing separately for test runs and storage
2. add-ons: test analytics (contact us for pricing)
    1. test dependencies
    2. test informational value (how often does a test fail?)
    3. source code analytics (analyzes your source code for hotspots)
3. 

-------------------------------
Chargebee metered usage:
1. define a basic plan
2. the metering is a recurring add-on
3. I need to configure a web-hook to determine the billing
